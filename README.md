# CyberPack Pro 2.0 (Source Code)
Cyber cafe maintenance software

## History
In August of 2006, thought of making a DVD renting software as I was member of a big DVD renting company and regularly I rented software, games and movies, so the idea floated around my head. Using my own framework, within two weeks made a realistic software, however they criticized a lot, for example I didn’t add comments section for user management, they mentioned they few users are rude and they need to point those out. DVD damage feature and so on were not in the list. After that I analyzed thoroughly not only one business but several cyber cafes, DVD rents, computer sales, mobile recharge and worked for almost a year to build a café management software named ‘Cyber Pack Pro’. It was very organized, packages can be bought separately as module. Software was great many people liked it but marketing wasn’t good. Sold only 10 copies, however I learned a lot while marketing, how people think and it’s hard to sell software in our country because they mostly think it’s free.
